1.== Introduction ==

  The OpenUDC project aims to provide a open, democratic and secure
  monetary system, compatible with universal dividend.

  This document describe the authentication mechanisms used in the
  OpenUDC implementations.

  This authentication mechanisms use and are compliant with the OpenPGP
  standard [RFC4880].

2.== Conventions Used in This Document ==

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.== Using OpenPGP certificates ==

3.1= specific uid =

  OpenUDC use widely OpenPGP standards for all authentications.

  An OpenUDC certificate is an OpenPGP certificate on which the comment
  field of one of its uid begin with the special string know as "udid2".

  As the OpenUDC characterization only use uid in an OpenPGP certifcate
  it is more accurate to speak about OpenUDC uid (inside an OpenPGP
  certificate) instead of OpenUDC certificate.

  The special string recognized by OpenUDC implementations is a sum of
  fields which MUST be separated by a semicolon ';'.

  The string MUST use only US-ASCII charset (without the semicolon which
  is reserved for separation of fields).

  The string size MUST NOT exceed 255 octets.

  First field (a.k.a. header field) indicate the meaning and the number
  of its following fields.

  OpenUDC specifies the 3 following headers field in uid comment :

    - "udid1"
        Was used for Human Authentication, now deprecated.
    - "udid2"
        Used for Human Authentication.
    - "udbot1"
        Used for Bot Authentication.
    - "udnode1"
        Used for Node Authentication.

  The charaters after the last recognized field in the string SHOULD be
  ignored and MAY use other charset (UTF-8...). They MAY be use to add
  informations in a non-universal language.

3.2= Key Types =

    We recommended to use a big main key of for the OpenPGP certificate,
    and at least 2 subkeys in it :
    - 1 for encryption.
    - 1 for signing OpenUDC transactions and so to be use as nominative
      account.

    As smallest keys implie smallest signatures, it is recommended to
    use ECC Keys to improve performance of OpenUDC networks.

3.3= Exporting =

    Certificates MUST be exported to some well-know sks key servers.

    Sks servers MAY be enhanced to register only OpenUDC certificate,
    and to unregister automatically OpenUDC certificate wich are not
    validated periodically by some other certificate.

3.4= Expiration =

    The main key of the OpenPGP certificate should expired in less than
    11 years after its creation.

4.== Human Authentication ==

  Each human which want to use an OpenUDC currency and receive a
  Universal Dividende (or an other basic income) MUST have a OpenPGP
  certificate in accordance with the following specification.

4.1.= OpenUDC Unique identification string =

    An OpenUDC user MUST have, in one of its OpenPGP uid, a comment
    which begins with a special string.

    This strings look like :

    udid2;c;BRUCKER;JEAN-JACQUES;1980-12-05;e+45.43+004.43;0;

    or :

    udid2;h;0b42ec04074e9b4138f5fdd524335f8fc2f9900f;0;

4.1.1. Universal Digital IDentity string version 1.


    The "udid1;" header MUST be followed by 4 fields which MUST define :

    1- The last names of the individual, separated by a comma.

    2- The fornames of the individual, separated by a comma.

    3- The date of birth, formated as number of seconds since
       00:00:00 UTC on Thursday, 1 January 1970.
       For people born before this date, the string will indicate a
       negative number prefixed with a charater '-'.
       If the hour of birth is unknow, it SHOULD be fixed at
       12:00:00 UTC.

    4- The location of birth, defined as terrestrial coordinates.
       The first number MUST be the latitude and MUST be prefixed by
       'N' or '+' if in the Northern hemispheres, and prefixed by
       'S' or '-' if in the Southern hemispheres.
       The second number MUST be the longitude and MUST be prefixed
       by 'E' or '+' in the east from the Greenwich meridian, and
       by 'W' or '-' in the west from the Greenwich meridian.

       Latitude and longitude MUST have at least 2 digits after the
       decimal point, and at most 6 digits after the decimal point.

       Accepted range for latitude is [-90.00;+90.00].
       Accepted range for longitude is [-179.999999;+180.00].

       Second subfield is optionnal and may be use to define
       non-terrestrial birth.

    Note: The version 1 is deprecated and should not be used anymore.

4.1.2. Universal Digital IDentity string version 2.

    The "udid2;" header MUST be followed by a one-char field which
    define if the birth datas are in clear or hashed :
    - 'c' char means the data are not hashed.
    - 'h' char means the data are hashed.

    The hashed version is obtained by applying the SHA1 algorithm on
    the clear version.

    Because now we can hash the udid, we have no more place for
    fuzziness in it, and so the rules of the clear version are very
    strict :

    The clear version "udid2;c;" MUST be followed by 5 fields:

    1- The last last name as written on the birth certificate.
       Only the 26 upper case [A-Z] US-ASCII characters are allowed.
       That means it have to be transposed in a standardized way to
       this US-ASCII characters.

       The transposed name MUST contain at least 1 character and
       MUST not exceed 20 characters. If it reach the 20-chars
       limit, extra characters MUST be ignored.

    2- The first first name as written on the birth certificate.
       Only the 27 upper case [A-Z-] US-ASCII characters are allowed.
       That means it have to be transposed in a standardized way to
       this US-ASCII characters.

       The transposed name MUST contain at least 1 character and
       MUST not exceed 20 characters. If it reach the 20-chars
       limit, extra characters MUST be ignored.

    3- The date of birth as written on the birth certificate, but
       transposed, as specified by the ISO-8601, in the extended
       form: "YYYY-mm-dd".

    4- The location of birth. As long as individuals are born on
       earth, it should be prefixed by a 'e' (lower case) character.
       Then following is defined as terrestrial coordinates.

       The first number MUST be the latitude and MUST be a 4 digits
       number : 2 before the decimal point and 2 after, prefixed by
       '+' if in the Northern hemispheres, and prefixed by '-' if in
       the Southern hemispheres.
       The second number MUST be the longitude and MUST be a 5 digits
       number : 3 before the decimal point and 2 after, prefixed by
       by '+' in the east from the Greenwich meridian, and by '-' in
       the west from the Greenwich meridian.

       Accepted range for latitude is [-90.00;+90.00].
       Accepted range for longitude is [-179.99;+180.00].

       For a given place of birth, only one coordinate is allowed.
       It should correspond to the coordinate of the office which
       write the birth certificate. And so in general to the
       coordinate that indicate almost all map tools (like
       googlemap).

    5- A number wich may increase in the case of more than one
       children born with the same last name and first name at the
       same place at the same date.
       This number should so be equal to 0 for almost every one.

    The hashed version "udid2;h;" MUST be followed by 2 fields:

    1- The SHA1 of the string composed by the fields "1;2;3;4"
       of the clear version (with the three ';' delimiters).

    2- A number wich may increase in the case of more than one
       children born with the same last name and first name at the
       same place at the same date, or if SHA1 collision.
       (2^63 operations are needed to meet an SHA1 collision, and
       there is today less than 2^33 humans on earth...)
       This number should so be equal to 0 for almost every one.

  example: if a individual is registered as
         - first names: François-Xavier-Robert,Lucien
         - last name: DE CLÉREL-DE-TOCQUEVILLE
         - birth date: 14 July 1989
         - birthplace: Paris 15

    its clear udid2 will be :

   udid2;c;TOCQUEVILLE;FRANCOIS-XAVIER-ROBE;1989-07-14;e+48.84+002.30;0;

    and its hashed udid2 will be :

   udid2;h;85bbb64915ae7f2cdbe54618453b3ed107f1f242;0;

   Note1: the SHA1 can be calculated with the sha1sum tool on almost
    all recent Unix systems.

   Note2: to transpose some europeans characters to US-ASCII charset,
     uni2ascii tool may help.
     (http://billposer.org/Software/uni2ascii.html)

4.2= Proof of identity =

    The identity is trusted by using the OpenPGP web of trust. It means
    signing an OpenUDC uid is something to do seriously and imply to
    check ID of the individuals to sign.

    If a cheat is discovered, eg.:
     - signing a person which doesn't exist.
     - signing an udid which point to somebody else.
     - signing an udid2 which doesn't match the standard described in
       this document ([RFCXXXX]).
    the signatories will be held accountable and may be prosecuted.

4.3= Implicit living trust level =

    For each people inside a web of trust, levels of trust may be
    calculated, depending on such parameters:
     1 - The number of signatories.
     2 - The level of trust of the signatories.
     3 - The age of the signatures.
     4 - A level indicated by signatories.
     5 - A level indicated by other humans in the web of trust.

    OpenUDC defines as "implicit living trust level" those where the
    "age of signatures" parameter may do it collapse.

    But that implies that people don't sign for dead one, wich is not
    forbidden. So this living trust level is not (enough) reliable.

4.4= Explicit living trust level =

    Also OpenUDC define four notations to be recognized inside a
    certificate signature:
        _alive@-=YYYY-mm-dd
        _dead@-=YYYY-mm-dd
        _birth@-=YYYY-mm-dd
        _death@-=YYYY-mm-dd
    
    Were the '-' character may be replaced by a string with any
    characters except the character '@' and the character '='. This
    string may be use to indicate a place and so may contain, for
    example, a name or a coordinate.

    And were "YYYY-mm-dd" is a date, as specified by the ISO-8601, which
    indicate when the signatorie have checked the identity and the life
    of the certificate's owner.

    Note: The "_birth@..." and "_death@..." notations are reserved for
    witnesses to such events.

    OpenUDC defines as "explicit living trust level" those relying on
    this 4 notations. If the "alive" status is not updated regularly,
    individual may supposed to be dead.
    
4.5= Proof of life =

    The proof of life is related with the money creation and the
    explicit living trust level: if someone in the web of trust does not
    create the share of new money which is reserved for him before a
    given date, or if its explicit living trust level become lower than
    a minimal required. He will be presumed "dead" and will be remove
    for the calculation of the next money set.

    The share of money which "dead" people have not created however is
    counted in the monetary mass, and anyone who obtains the private key
    (eg: his heirs) may create that share, thereafter.

    If a cheat is discovered, eg. if someone or something (a robot) use
    the private secret of somebody else or somebody dead (without being
    noticed as such), then:
    investigation ("Cui prodest scelus is fecit"), prosecution, etc ...

5.== Bot Authentication ==

  Only humans may be trusted and held responsible. But humans like to
  build and use tool to improve their productivity and comfort.

  Today science, mechanics and computer progress make the tools more
  complex and independants. Humans may programm such tools to take
  important decisions and make important actions.

  This news tools are named robots or simply bots.

  In OpenUDC networks there are bots to validate transactions. But
  bots may be programmed to do nasty things, or to lie. 

  To prevent that, each bot are authenticated as a human's minion:

  Each bots have their own OpenPGP certificate, and one of the uid
  comment field MUST begin with the special string "udbot1;" ,
  followed immediately by the full udid2 of its master.

  e.g.: the OpenPGP certificate of François-Xavier-Robert's bot MUST
  have this string in the comment field of one of its uid:

  udbot1;udid2;h;85bbb64915ae7f2cdbe54618453b3ed107f1f242;0;

  And this OpenPGP uid MUST be signed by the human master to proove
  she/he recognized this minion.

  The bot certificate SHOULD design a key of it human master as
  revocation key.

  Note: take care that private key(s) of bots are often not protected
  by a passphrase.

6.== Node Authentication ==

    As long as a single network will be enough to trade efficiently in
    a given web of trust, splitting the network into different node will
    not be mandatory.

    (Today, 31 may 2011) Node specification may wait.
